# Microservice Architecture with Spring Boot

Welcome to the Microservice Architecture with Spring Boot documentation! This documentation provides an overview of the microservice architecture implemented in our system, which is built using Spring Boot.

## Overview

Our system is composed of several microservices that communicate with each other using RESTful APIs. Each microservice is responsible for a specific business domain, and they work together to provide a seamless experience to the end-user.

The microservices in our system are:

* **Authentication Service** - This microservice handles user authentication and authorization.

* **Product Service** - This microservice manages the products available in our system.

* **Order Service** - This microservice handles orders placed by the users.

* **Payment Service** - This microservice handles payment processing.

* **Notification Service** - This microservice handles sending notifications to the users.

All microservices are designed to be stateless and can be scaled up or down as needed.

## API Gateway

To provide a unified entry point to our system, we use an API Gateway implemented using Spring Cloud Gateway. The API Gateway is responsible for routing incoming requests to the appropriate microservice based on the URI path.

## Service Discovery

We use Netflix Eureka for service discovery, which allows our microservices to register themselves with the Eureka server and discover other microservices registered with the same server. This makes it easy to locate and communicate with other microservices in our system.

## Load Balancing

We use Ribbon for client-side load balancing, which allows us to distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of the same microservice. This helps improve the overall performance and scalability of our system.

## Conclusion

Our microservice architecture with Spring Boot provides a robust and scalable solution for our system. We hope this documentation provides a clear overview of our system's architecture and helps you understand how the different components work together.
